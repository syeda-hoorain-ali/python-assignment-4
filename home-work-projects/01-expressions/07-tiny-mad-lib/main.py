    One day, a {adjective} Python programmer named {name} was working on a {noun}.
    Suddenly, their code started {verb_ing}! 😱
    They quickly checked Stack Overflow, but the answer was just "{funny_phrase}". 🤦‍♂️
    
    Desperate, they tried debugging with {random_object}, but instead, their computer started {random_action}. 💥
    In the end, they fixed the bug by {silly_method}, and their program finally printed:
