## Problem Statement

Prompt the user to enter the lengths of each side of a triangle and then calculate and print the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of all of the side lengths).

Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

What is the length of side 1? 3 

What is the length of side 2? 4 

What is the length of side 3? 5.5 

The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5

## Starter Code

```py
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
