    I was writing a {adjective} Python script when suddenly, {name} yelled 😱,
    "Why is this {noun} not working?! 😩"

    Turns out, they forgot to {verb1} the {noun} before running it. 🤦‍♂️
    After {number} hours of debugging ⏰, the solution was just adding a {symbol} ⚡️.

    Moral of the story: Always {verb1} before you {verb2}! 😅💡
